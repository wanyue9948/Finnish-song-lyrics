I sing a little song for you

only for you, for you Sofia

only for you, for you Sofia

I have a daisy in my hat

only for you, for you Sofia

only for you, for you Sofia

when I left you it was midsummer

when I left you in the year of twenty nine

how could I have guessed

that I would never return

I have a daisy in my hat

only for you, for you Sofia

only for you, for you Sofia

how could I have guessed

that I would never return
