1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,266
I sing a little song for you

2
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:07,733
only for you, for you Sofia

3
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:15,166
only for you, for you Sofia

4
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:24,500
I have a daisy in my hat

5
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:30,433
only for you, for you Sofia

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,666
only for you, for you Sofia

7
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:47,533
when I left you it was midsummer

8
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:55,133
when I left you in the year of twenty nine

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,533
how could I have guessed

10
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:08,233
that I would never return

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,833
I have a daisy in my hat

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,933
only for you, for you Sofia

13
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,866
only for you, for you Sofia

14
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:55,266
how could I have guessed

15
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:01,066
that I would never return
