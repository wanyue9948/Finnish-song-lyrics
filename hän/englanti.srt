1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She,made me believe,she.

2
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,200
Made me hope,she,

3
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,333
And lots more

4
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:55,233
She,made me laugh,she,

5
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:59,866
Made me sing,she,

6
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:04,133
Gave me a melody

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,500
She,the fairy good mother,she,

8
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,900
The queen of the night,she,

9
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:21,433
Is now a mere name of a schlager

10
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:30,900
She,now as the summer changes to autumn and I can see the leaves flutter

11
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
I feel the same agony,

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When she's away

13
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:27,700
She,made me laugh,she,

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,333
Made me sing,she,

15
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:37,366
Gave me a melody

16
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:44,933
She,again I'm tuning my guitar again,

17
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,466
And I hear the familiar tinkle again,

18
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,833
As if she were with me
