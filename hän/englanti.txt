She,made me believe,she.

Made me hope,she,

And lots more

She,made me laugh,she,

Made me sing,she,

Gave me a melody

She,the fairy good mother,she,

The queen of the night,she,

Is now a mere name of a schlager

She,now as the summer changes to autumn and I can see the leaves flutter

I feel the same agony,

When she's away

She,made me laugh,she,

Made me sing,she,

Gave me a melody

She,again I'm tuning my guitar again,

And I hear the familiar tinkle again,

As if she were with me
