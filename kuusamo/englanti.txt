Kuusamo

Helsinki

A smoky, foggy city

People don't know even their neighbour

Everyone's in a hurry

Only a few in here smile

Invisible strings are pulling and ripping apart marionettes

Who are bouncing around like prey fish

Everyone's in a hurry to nowhere

Kuusamo

I can hear Kuusamo calling me

I see a sturdy forest

And a blue-shaded hill

Kuusamo

I can hear Kuusamo calling me

Only there will I find peace

Helsinki has no residents anymore

Only lonely people, which there are many

Too many

I wouldn't want to be one of them

I want to be free and breathe the smell of sprig

Here I'm like a prisoner

I shall go to Kuusamo

Kuusamo

I can hear Kuusamo calling me

I see a sturdy forest

And a blue-shaded hill

Kuusamo

I can hear Kuusamo calling me

Only there

will I find peace

Far away

Joy is far away

I lost my peace of mind

But perhaps I'll get it back

The only

Place without hate

Wilderness

Share it with me

Kuusamo

I can hear Kuusamo calling me
