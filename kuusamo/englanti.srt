1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Kuusamo

2
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,100
Helsinki

3
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,066
A smoky, foggy city

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,400
People don't know even their neighbour

5
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,500
Everyone's in a hurry

6
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,333
Only a few in here smile

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,633
Invisible strings are pulling and ripping apart marionettes

8
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,466
Who are bouncing around like prey fish

9
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:24,133
Everyone's in a hurry to nowhere

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Kuusamo

11
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,666
I can hear Kuusamo calling me

12
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,933
I see a sturdy forest

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
And a blue-shaded hill

14
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,333
Kuusamo

15
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,566
I can hear Kuusamo calling me

16
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:52,533
Only there will I find peace

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,866
Helsinki has no residents anymore

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,200
Only lonely people, which there are many

19
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,400
Too many

20
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,066
I wouldn't want to be one of them

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,866
I want to be free and breathe the smell of sprig

22
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,633
Here I'm like a prisoner

23
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,233
I shall go to Kuusamo

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,900
Kuusamo

25
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,900
I can hear Kuusamo calling me

26
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,533
I see a sturdy forest

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
And a blue-shaded hill

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,066
Kuusamo

29
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:52,866
I can hear Kuusamo calling me

30
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,833
Only there

31
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,033
will I find peace

32
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,566
Far away

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Joy is far away

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,633
I lost my peace of mind

35
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,966
But perhaps I'll get it back

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,333
The only

37
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,333
Place without hate

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,066
Wilderness

39
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,566
Share it with me
