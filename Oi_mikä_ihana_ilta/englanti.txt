He sits at the beach bar

Drinks cold beer

He watches the ships

That sail by so slowly

Oh what a wonderful evening

Anything can happen

He meets many friends

But wishes he would meet someone

Who would be more than that

She gets up from the bathtub

Wraps her long hair in a towel

She paints her nails

Goes out into the warm air

Oh what a wonderful evening

Anything can happen

She meets many friends

But wishes she would meet someone

Who would be more than that

Oh what a wonderful evening

Anything can happen

He meets many friends

But wishes he would meet someone

Who would be more than that

Later on the beach boulevard

These two meet each other

They watch the ships for a while

Then go, Their separate ways again

Oh what a wonderful evening

Anything can happen

He meets many friends

But wishes he would meet someone

Who would be more than that

Oh what a wonderful evening

Anything can happen
