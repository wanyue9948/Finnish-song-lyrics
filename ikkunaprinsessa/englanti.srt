1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,700
A little boy can not trust women,

2
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:17,466
they produce a big longing in the little heart.

3
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:22,766
But to stare at the window, the little boy perhaps gets to do in evening,

4
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,266
therefrom the princess of my dream looks out.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,533
From behind the pane, from behind the pane,

6
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,100
from behind the pane, my girl just looks.

7
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:41,466
She is the most beautiful of women that I know,

8
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:46,400
I endure the small breasts on my princess.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,733
The hat is immaculate, and so is the body posture.

10
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,066
From behind the pane, my girl just looks.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,466
Oh, Glendora, oh Glendora,

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,733
oh Glendora, how I worship you.

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,500
Oh, Glendora, oh Glendora,

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,100
oh Glendora, how I worship you.

15
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,533
Once again I am at the window one evening,

16
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:46,300
now a guy enrobed another princess in a gown.

17
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,800
He enrobed the head and he enrobed the rest,

18
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:52,300
replacing it with a decorated doll.

19
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,700
Behind the pane, someone else took my girl.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,466
Behind the pane, behind the pane,

21
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,966
behind the pane, someone else took my girl.

22
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:12,266
Behind the pane, behind the pane,

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,966
behind the pane, someone else took my girl.

24
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,466
Someone else took her, someone else took her,

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,400
someone else took her, someone else took her,

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
someone else took her...
