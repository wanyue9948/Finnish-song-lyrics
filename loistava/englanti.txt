Windows upside down,
The sky is the thick soil,
I watch the Vikings as they boast
and soon the smallest one gets a punch.
If you're like me,
feeling a bit alone today,
you know that sometimes under the blanket
it's hard to find yourself.

I've survived before,
but now it doesn't work.

You should always be strong,
you should always be powerful,
can I give up if the coffee runs out,
Don't get up until tomorrow
and be wise,
It's so f**king brilliant.
They say you get used to everything
But this price tag sucks.
Be strong and powerful,
It's so f**king brilliant.

In the morning, I saw in the mirror,
There is no gold to be found today,
uncertainties just scream
that they want to be with you
and if you're like me,
it feels like you're going in circles,
you know that sometimes under the blanket
it's hard to find yourself.

I've survived before,
but now it doesn't work.

You should always be strong,
you should always be powerful,
can I give up if the coffee runs out,
Don't get up until tomorrow
and be wise,
It's so f**king brilliant.
They say you get used to everything
But this price tag sucks.

Be strong and powerful,
It's so f**king brilliant.
Be strong and powerful,
It's so f**king brilliant.

I've survived before,
but now it doesn't work.

You should always be strong,
you should always be powerful,
can I give up if the coffee runs out,
Don't get up until tomorrow
and be wise,
It's so f**king brilliant.
They say you get used to everything
But this price tag sucks.

Be strong and powerful,
It's so f**king brilliant.
Be strong and powerful,
It's so f**king brilliant.
