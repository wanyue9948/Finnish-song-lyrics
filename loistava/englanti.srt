1
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,900
Windows upside down,

2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,766
The sky is the thick soil,

3
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,233
I watch the Vikings as they boast

4
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,333
and soon the smallest one gets a punch.

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,733
If you're like me,

6
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,933
feeling a bit alone today,

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
you know that sometimes under the blanket

8
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,633
it's hard to find yourself.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,366
I've survived before,

10
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,100
but now it doesn't work.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,700
You should always be strong,

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,000
you should always be powerful,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,066
can I give up if the coffee runs out,

14
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,400
Don't get up until tomorrow

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,133
and be wise,

16
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,700
It's so f**king brilliant.

17
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,500
They say you get used to everything

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
But this price tag sucks.

19
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,300
Be strong and powerful,

20
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:20,000
It's so f**king brilliant.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,266
In the morning, I saw in the mirror,

22
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,866
There is no gold to be found today,

23
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,266
uncertainties just scream

24
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,166
that they want to be with you

25
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,533
and if you're like me,

26
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,000
it feels like you're going in circles,

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,733
you know that sometimes under the blanket

28
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,733
it's hard to find yourself.

29
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,466
I've survived before,

30
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,200
but now it doesn't work.

31
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,533
You should always be strong,

32
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,866
you should always be powerful,

33
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,166
can I give up if the coffee runs out,

34
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,500
Don't get up until tomorrow

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,166
and be wise,

36
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,300
It's so f**king brilliant.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,466
They say you get used to everything

38
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,466
But this price tag sucks.

39
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,266
Be strong and powerful,

40
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,766
It's so f**king brilliant.

41
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:24,066
Be strong and powerful,

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,733
It's so f**king brilliant.

43
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,533
I've survived before,

44
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,566
but now it doesn't work.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,433
You should always be strong,

46
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,900
you should always be powerful,

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
can I give up if the coffee runs out,

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,266
Don't get up until tomorrow

49
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,000
and be wise,

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,266
It's so f**king brilliant.

51
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,500
They say you get used to everything

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,033
But this price tag sucks.

53
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,433
Be strong and powerful,

54
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,300
It's so f**king brilliant.

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,100
Be strong and powerful,

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
It's so f**king brilliant.
