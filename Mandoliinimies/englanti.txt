Hey friend, wipe off your tears of pain,

you're making them in vain,

I'm carrying my mandolin on top of my backpack.

Yeah, I remember you;

I wrote your address on it too,

I wrote your address on it too.

This journey of the travelin' Mandolin Man

is so full of life that I can

sometimes forget how there's someone waiting for me.

But I remember you

I wrote your name on the mandolin too,

I wrote your name on the mandolin too.

I'll toast for you somewhere,

I'll bring you something there.

I could of course fill my bottle with mountain air,

or with Atlantic water's flair

I'll bring them to you when I get back there,

I'll bring them to you when I get back there.

Hey stranger listen to this song

as the wine warms us daylong!

I wrote these stanzas on the back of my mandolin,

soon you'll know too

the girl who I left when away I flew,

the girl who I left when away I flew.

I'll toast for you somewhere,

I'll bring you something there.

I could of course fill my bottle with mountain air,

or with Atlantic water's flair

I'll bring them to you when I get back there,

I'll bring them to you when I get back there.

Hey friend, wipe off your tears of pain,

you're making them in vain,

I'm carrying my mandolin on top of my backpack.

Yeah, I remember you;

I wrote your address on it too,

I wrote your address on it too.
