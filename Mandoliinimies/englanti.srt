1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey friend, wipe off your tears of pain,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,266
you're making them in vain,

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:14,866
I'm carrying my mandolin on top of my backpack.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,866
Yeah, I remember you;

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,300
I wrote your address on it too,

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,266
I wrote your address on it too.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,666
This journey of the travelin' Mandolin Man

8
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,933
is so full of life that I can

9
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:44,566
sometimes forget how there's someone waiting for me.

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,800
But I remember you

11
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:53,066
I wrote your name on the mandolin too,

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,400
I wrote your name on the mandolin too.

13
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,333
I'll toast for you somewhere,

14
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,133
I'll bring you something there.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,733
I could of course fill my bottle with mountain air,

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
or with Atlantic water's flair

17
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:28,266
I'll bring them to you when I get back there,

18
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:34,366
I'll bring them to you when I get back there.

19
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,466
Hey stranger listen to this song

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
as the wine warms us daylong!

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,700
I wrote these stanzas on the back of my mandolin,

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,566
soon you'll know too

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,166
the girl who I left when away I flew,

24
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:04,500
the girl who I left when away I flew.

25
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,333
I'll toast for you somewhere,

26
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
I'll bring you something there.

27
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:25,466
I could of course fill my bottle with mountain air,

28
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,333
or with Atlantic water's flair

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,766
I'll bring them to you when I get back there,

30
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:39,866
I'll bring them to you when I get back there.

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,966
Hey friend, wipe off your tears of pain,

32
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,633
you're making them in vain,

33
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:55,633
I'm carrying my mandolin on top of my backpack.

34
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,433
Yeah, I remember you;

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,433
I wrote your address on it too,

36
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:10,166
I wrote your address on it too.
