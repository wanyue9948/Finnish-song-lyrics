1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,233
I sing my last song and leave

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,000
And I won't ever come back to you

3
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:11,366
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,766
Into the forest I vanish and dig my grave

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,466
Maybe I'll shed a tear for you

6
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:22,866
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)

7
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:26,466
I wake up in the city center, the air is cool, I have to leave

8
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,400
They don't understand, darkness falls before you wake up

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,333
I'm a ghost, I'm a phantom, you won't see me again

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,100
But it's not your fault, I don't want to see anyone anymore

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,166
I've lost my significance in this circus

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,066
Now the curtain falls, I stop this performance

13
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:44,200
This isn't me, the one I lost, I'm searching now

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,933
And even though I won't come back, you were special to me

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,700
I sing my last song and leave

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,233
And I won't ever come back to you

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,666
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,333
Into the forest I vanish and dig my grave

19
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,033
Maybe I'll shed a tear for you

20
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:09,333
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)

21
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,066
Birds follow me in the city, they want to peck at me

22
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:16,266
They're like a horror story, I dare not move

23
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:18,733
When I'm losing it, the sky is always dark with birds

24
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,766
When I'm not, they're not there, the birds are just an illusion

25
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:24,666
I have black superstar sneakers, black Rikus on my feet

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,433
I'm a mixer of chaos, I'm neither a bird nor a fish

27
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:30,466
I've crossed the border, dear, I won't come back anymore

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,433
I don't want to make money, I want everything to burn

29
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,233
I sing my last song and leave

30
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,933
And I won't ever come back to you

31
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:44,366
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)

32
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,833
Into the forest I vanish and dig my grave

33
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,466
Maybe I'll shed a tear for you

34
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:56,566
I disappear without a trace (Haahh)
