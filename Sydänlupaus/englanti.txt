Once the promise of heart was given

Promise of heart between us two

No power or force

That can take it away

Do you remember that promise of heart

Promise of heart that binds us together

Promise of heart forever

No place or time

Can change its magic

Do you remember that promise of heart

Promise of heart is a secret

Only for two people

Others do not need to know

Others do not need to bear it

Do you remember that promise of heart

Promise of heart never to be forgotten

Do you remember when we once stood

On a winter night under the stars

And with a quick kiss

Sealed the promise of heart

Promise of heart is a secret

Only for two people

Others do not need to know

Others do not need to bear it

Do you remember that heart promise

Do you remember that heart promise
