1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Once the promise of heart was given

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,866
Promise of heart between us two

3
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,100
No power or force

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
That can take it away

5
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:50,266
Do you remember that promise of heart

6
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:58,300
Promise of heart that binds us together

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,266
Promise of heart forever

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,500
No place or time

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,900
Can change its magic

10
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:15,466
Do you remember that promise of heart

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Promise of heart is a secret

12
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:28,000
Only for two people

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,733
Others do not need to know

14
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,866
Others do not need to bear it

15
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:40,600
Do you remember that promise of heart

16
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:13,666
Promise of heart never to be forgotten

17
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,566
Do you remember when we once stood

18
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,133
On a winter night under the stars

19
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,566
And with a quick kiss

20
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:31,400
Sealed the promise of heart

21
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:39,300
Promise of heart is a secret

22
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,600
Only for two people

23
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,500
Others do not need to know

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,766
Others do not need to bear it

25
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:56,566
Do you remember that promise of heart

26
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:22,233
Do you remember that promise of heart
