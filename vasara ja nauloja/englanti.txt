For almost three years we have built this house

Even the thought gives pain,

If the building won't end here

Sometimes it makes me want to suck my thumb,

Though the attempt is ruthless

Through the stone, bottom first to tree

When we climb along the night

You are no man,

If you can't build a house with your own hands

I will beat all hardships and delays

No nigger will believe,

What a terrible fuss it brings

When you get the wrong blueprint and utensils

Hammer and nails,for worth lots of money

So,when you can saw with a saw

That glass wool

Used in insulation work

More rotten boards and those

Element bars,with these

Rough necessity needs

We saved pennies again

Wool stuffed used in thermal insulation in between the asbest wall,

Not excatly a piece of art

But it keeps the cold away well

My wife moved away to her sister when these

Women don't seem to understand

How quickly the time passes by

Though you are pushing hard

You are no man...

No nigger will believe...

A hammer and nails...

vasara ja nauloja...

More rotten boards...

I am straightening the nails,

In the porch of my own house,though

Even with good will I guess

One won't recognize it's a house

I have everything under control

But I'm not the one with control,

You can easily pass the sunny summer days

When you build up a house like this

A hammer and nails...

A hammer and nails...
